Course materials for Research Software Engineering course.

Current plan for structure:

Research Software Engineering

Content:
In this course, you will move beyond programming, to learn how to construct reliable, readable, efficient research software in a collaborative environment. The emphasis is on practical techniques, tips, and technologies to effectively build and maintain complex code. This is a short (15 hours over 5 half-days), intensive, practical course. The content of each of the 5 half-day units is as follows:

1. Code management. Collaborating around code. Distributed version control. Git. Github. Issue tracking. Code review and pull requests. Branches and merging. Continuous Integration. Citing software. Software sustainability.
1. Testing scientific software. Unit testing, regression testing. Test driven design. Expectations and assertions. Mocking. Negative testing. Sensible error messages. Error handling. Debugging and debuggers.
1. Best practice in construction. Comments. Coding conventions. Documentation. Refactoring. IDEs. Configuration files. Using libraries.
1. Design and development. Object oriented design. Software as engineering. Pragmatic use of diagram languages. Requirements engineering. Agile and Waterfall. Functional and architectural design.
1. Building and deployment. Build tools. Packaging. Deploying. Open Source community and interaction.

## Prerequisites:

Lesson Zero covers installation of Python and Jupyter Notebooks, and we recommend you go through this material _before_ starting the course.

Examples and exercises for this course will be provided in Python.  You will therefore find it easiest to follow along if you have experience in that language. Appropriate Python experience could be obtained from the Software Carpentry Bootcamp. Previous experience with version control (such as from Software Carpentry) would be helpful.

You are required to bring your own laptop to the course as the classrooms we are using do not have desktop computers.
