    "\n",
    " 1. What could go wrong? If you would like a hint for one example, disconnect your computer from the network before running the code cell.\n",
    " 2. For each thing that goes wrong, what should the program do? Should it give up and tell the user, or try again, or use a different approach to solving its problem?\n",
    " 3. If you're going to tell the user that the program failed, what information might they need to diagnose the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Try introducing errors into the program, e.g. by replacing a variable with a bad value, to see what can fail, and whether the error is appropriately handled. If a particular situation leads to an error and you can't see why (or doesn't when you think it should), then try using the debugger to understand what is going on."
