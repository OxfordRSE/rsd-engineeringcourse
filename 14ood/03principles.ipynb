The design must make good use of object-oriented principles to ensure a close association between the features of the design, and the features of the problem being solved. Ideally the design should make easy to change the things about the problem domain that are most likely to change."

    "> Quantum chromodynamics is the fundamental theory to describe the dynamics of quarks and gluons in hadrons[1].  The gluons are non-Abelian SU(3) gauge field interacting with quarks. At low-energy, QCD has tow [sic] distinct features: the confinement and the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry. The former confines quarks and gluons in hadrons, and the latter is the origin of large ejective masses of quarks and light pseudoscalar mesons such as pions. The QCD coupling has [the] striking feature that it decreases at short length (the asymptotic freedom)."

The benefit of such \"information hiding\" is that knowledge of how one class works and what its constraints are can be confined to that class, because nothing else in the system knows enough about the innards of that class to do its own calculations in parallel. This improves the maintainability of the code, because a change in that implementation is confined to one place.\n",
