    "\n",
    " - the human/technical system which has the problem we intend to solve in software;\n",
    " - the human/technical system which is the group of people solving the problem;\n",
    " - the software itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to ensure that our software output (product, app, library, service, etc) solves the problem that the customers or other stakeholders have, in a way that's efficient for the engineering team to build and maintain. Further, we need everything to be sensitive to changes caused whether externally or by the act of introducing the software. A design is a way of capturing our knowledge about these issues and exploring how a potential solution could trade them off to good advantage, without going to the expense and effort of building the whole thing and discovering it isn't feasible."
