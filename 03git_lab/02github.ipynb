    "When you buy things in the supermarkets, there are often special promotional deals that make it cheaper to buy multiple items than the standard unit price. These are called \"multibuy\" promotions. It might be, for example, that a particular bottle of fizzy drink costs £1.20, but you can buy three for the price of two (i.e. 3 bottles costs £2.40). How much would it cost to buy seven drinks? There are two sets of three drinks at £2.40 each, making £4.80, then one bottle at the individual price of £1.20, so the total is £6.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to write checkout software in Python that calculates the total price of a shopping basket, taking multibuy discounts into account. A customer basket is represented as a Python dictionary, with the names of products as keys with the quantity in the basket as values:"

Now decide how you're going to share this work between you, how you will synchronise and resolve conflicts, and how you will publish, review and accept pull requests between the members of your team."
