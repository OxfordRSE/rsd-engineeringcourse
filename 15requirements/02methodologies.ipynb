    "# Software Project Methodologies\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by unpicking that word. \"Methodology\" _ought_ to have something to do with the study or analysis ($\\lambda \\omicron \\gamma \\omicron \\sigma$) of processes or procedures ($\\mu \\epsilon \\theta \\omicron \\delta \\omicron \\sigma$). In many cases, it does, but not so much in software.\n",
    "\n",
    "In software engineering, a \"methodology\" is just a method. More specifically, it's frequently used to describe high-level frameworks for project management and planning. It's not used so much for the detailed planning of a software implementation (the word \"paradigm\" is common there).\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, software development methodologies went from \"none/ad hoc/we don't know\" (in the early days of computing, the hardware engineering was seen as the clever bit and the software was just an administrative detail) through waterfall, iterative and incremental, to Agile. Various attempts to define post-Agile methodologies including Software Craftsmanship and DevOps do not significantly update the values or principles on which Agile development is founded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Waterfall\n",
    "\n",
    "Famously, waterfall software project management is supposedly based on a big misunderstanding, so it's only mentioned here as a (large) historical quirk. In [Managing the Development of Large Software Systems](https://holub.com/goodies/royce.waterfall.pdf), Winston W. Royce described what is now known as the waterfall process, though he did not use that word himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process described by Royce has seven stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. System Requirements\n",
    "2. Software Requirements\n",
    "3. Analysis\n",
    "4. Program Design\n",
    "5. Coding\n",
    "6. Testing\n",
    "7. Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "![Schematic of the waterfall software development process, adapted from Figure 2 in _Managing the Development of Large Software Systems_.](waterfall.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step informs the next, so a sequential flow is imagined, like water down a waterfall. In fact Royce allowed that a stage could inform its immediate predecessor, e.g. attempts to build a program design might uncover defects in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "He then tore down this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I believe in this concept, but the implementation described above is risky and invites failure. The problem is illustrated in Figure 4. The testing phase which occurs at the end of the development cycle is the first event for which timing, storage, input/output transfers, etc., are experienced as distinguished from analyzed. These phenomena are not precisely analyzable. They are not the solutions to the standard partial differential equations of mathematical physics for instance. Yet if these phenomena fail to satisfy the various external constraints, then invariably a major redesign is required. A simple octal patch or redo of some isolated code will not fix these kinds of difficulties. The required design changes are likely to be so disruptive that the software requirements upon which the design is based and which provides the rationale for everything are violated. Either the requirements must be modified, or a substantial change in the design is required. In effect the development process has returned to the origin and one can expect up to a 100-percent overrun in schedule and/or costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of the article looked at iterative and incremental modifications to this structure \"to eliminate most of the development risks.\" If the folk history of software engineering is to be believed, software project managers the world over leapt on this paper, turned to Figure 2, decided \"yes, this will be fine\", and a couple of decades of expensive overruns ensued, before iterative and incremental development was invented.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact this version of history is not in accordance with reality. In 1968, at the NATO conference on Software Engineering in Garmisch, Alan Perlis had already said:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Through successive repetitions of this process of interlaced testing and design the model ultimately becomes the software system itself. I think that it is the key of the approach that has been suggested, that there is no such question as testing things after the fact with simulation models, but that in effect the testing and the replacement of simulations with modules that are deeper and more detailed goes on with the simulation model controlling, as it were, the place and order in which these things are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wherever people got the idea from, and whyever they didn't evaluate alternatives, waterfall project management was important for a very long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Iterative and Incremental Development\n",
    "\n",
    "By the 1990s, software engineering experts were either ready to read past page 4 in Royce's article or reinvent the same content. Various models were proposed that were iterative (multiple small projects progressing toward the goal, rather than one large project that completely missed it) and incremental (each small project delivers a successive addition to the larger system).\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative and incremental approaches each have the benefit of reducing risk when compared with the waterfall method. An iterative project produces some output at the end of each iteration, so problems can be identified early and changes planned. Incremental development means each iteration produces a contribution toward the value of the overall system, so that in principle the customer could start using the product before the software project is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes these increments were colouring-in projects, in which the early increments delivered the high-level architecture (sometimes called a \"walking skeleton\") and the later increments successively added different features. Sometimes they were more like end-to-end slices through the whole system (the analogy \"tracer bullet\" is often used), demonstrating the feasibility or utility of whole features at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agile Software Development\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2001, a collection of software engineers who were practised and experienced with iterative and incremental practices met at a ski resort in Utah and wrote the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/). The practices undertaken by agile software engineers look a lot like iterative and incremental development, it's the _values_ and _principles_ that motivate the selection and evaluation of practices that they called out. In particular, the manifesto authors value:\n",
    "\n",
    " - individuals and interactions over processes and tools;\n",
    " - working software over comprehensive documentation;\n",
    " - customer collaboration over contract negotiation;\n",
    " - responding to change over following a plan.\n",
    " \n",
    "These values led Agile teams to try to work with customers as closely as possible, preferably in the same office. The idea of the \"daily stand-up\" comes from Agile developers, and is supposed to involve the customer or their representative so that they get a view on what's happening, what problems there are, and a say in where to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, while frequent builds are a feature of any iterative and incremental system, it is Agile development that values giving these builds to the customer as early as possible and incorporating their feedback into the development process. Continuous integration and continuous delivery take this frequency to extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way, the idea of \"an Agile software project\" is oxymoronic. There can be no up-front idea of scope or schedule. Instead, an Agile team comes together and works with their customer while the work is producing value, and leaves or disbands when their efforts are no longer producing any benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is not to say that Agile practitioners eschew the trappings of management and process, merely that they avoid doing them _for their own sakes_. Sanjoy Mahajan said that too much rigor leads to _rigor mortis_, which may be true, but teams with no discipline at all will find that work grinds to a halt as nobody knows what anybody else is working on, what they _should_ be working on, which parts of the code represent good design, quick hacks, or huge mistakes, and so on. Notice that the manifesto authors say that they value, for example, working software _over_ comprehensive documentation, not _instead of_ comprehensive documentation."
