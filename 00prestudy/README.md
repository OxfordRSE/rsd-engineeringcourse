# Research Software Engineering pre-study material

You will learn how to install the software used on this course. Rather than repeat - potentially inaccurately - installation instructions here, links to guides on the project websites are given.

## Anaconda Distribution

Anaconda is a distribution of multiple tools for data scientists, including the Python programming language, Jupyter notebooks programming environment, and lots of libraries including many used on this course. The easiest way to get set up with the prerequisite tools for this course is to [install Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

When you have done that, navigate to this folder in your operating system's terminal shell (command prompt) and type:

`jupyter notebook`

You should see a notebook called `welcome.ipynb`. Open that notebook.

## git

`git` is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS), a way to track changes to source code and share those changes with collaborators in a controlled way. It forms the core of the [GitHub](https://github.com) social coding website.

### Windows

[Download and run the executable installer](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

### Mac

Either:

 - Install Apple's Integrated Developer Environment (IDE), Xcode, from the App Store. Open Xcode, and install the additional tools when prompted.

or:

 - `brew install git`, if you use homebrew.

### Linux

Check your distribution's package manager.

## A text editor

A lot of the labs in this course will use Jupyter notebooks, and if you installed Anaconda Distribution then you will have Jupyter already. To share Python code as libraries or standalone programs you will need to write it into plain text files with the `.py` extension. You can do this with Jupyter, but if you are already familiar with another text editor then feel welcome to use that.
